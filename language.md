# C

## [ISO/IEC C standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards)
- normative
- dense and strangely organized
- notoriously difficult to interpret, but worth reading (or skimming) anyway

## [The GNU C Reference Manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/)
- non-normative, except possibly where it describes GNU extensions
- much friendlier
- teasing apart standard and non-standard features can be annoying at times

## [The GNU C Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)
- excellent documentation
- somewhat self-aggrandizing


# Python

## Language Reference ([2](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html), [3](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html))
- section 3 (data model) is especially important
